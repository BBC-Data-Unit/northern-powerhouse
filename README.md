In June 2019 we [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-48664613) on claims that the Northern Powerhouse was being "undermined" by austerity despite signs of economic growth.

The Northern Powerhouse was first mentioned by the then Chancellor George Osborne in June 2014, when he outlined an ambition to bring together the cities, towns and rural communities of the north of England to fuel economic growth through modern transport links, devolved powers and increased investment.
